<script setup lang="ts">

// allow for various hover animations because I want to.
// mode 1: flow (what we first implemented for the nav links, a gradiant that shifts on hover)
// mode 2: dance (tilts 15 degrees left and right, grows and shrinks slightly, repeatedly while hovering) (like selecting something an option in a cartoony indie game)
// mode 3: slam (grows like a fist punching you, tilting slightly to the left on hover)
